  <h4>But first, a little about me!</h4>
  <p>My name is Scott Hutley. That's me to the right. I was born and raised in Oregon, but have also spent several of my adult years living in both southern California and the Olympia area of Washington. Growing up in the northwest I developed a love for the outdoors; camping, hiking, snowboarding, etc. However I also grew up in a time when home computers and the internet itself was in it's earliest stages of reaching the general public. It was inevitable that I transported my childhood love of arcades to the family <em>Commodore</em>, my first introduction to modems and these things called BBSs, onward still to my very own personal computer and naturally along with it the world wide web, trying my hand at all manner of RPGs, RTSs and MMOs along the way.</p>
  <p>Though my career arc thus far has not led me down a path of coding or development, I spent the better part of 16 years with Target working at their Distribution Centers as a teammate trainer and assisted in the inbound rollout of handheld RF Units as they transitioned from a pencil-paper-computer system of freight recieving to a more exclusively digital form.</p>
  <p><em>But now at long last I've come full circle and officially entered the world of coding!</em></p>
