## What is here?

This portfolio contains a collection of projects I've completed during my time at Epicodus as well as minor details about my job history and my future goals. This will be an ever-growing portfolio. As I continue to develop more coding skills, I will add more projects that showcase what I've learned and (hopefully) the direction my new experiences are taking me.
