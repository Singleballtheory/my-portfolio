  <h1>Upcoming Goals</h1>
  <p>Aside from making this portfolio look <em>way</em> more professional than it currently does, my main goals are relatively simple:
  <ol>
    <li>Finish this coding course.</li>
    <li>Find an internship and/or job that utilizes my skills.</li>
    <li>Contine to grow as both a coder and an individual.</li>
  </ol>
  This page, as in life, is a constant work in progress. There will no doubt be more projects to come and I am certain they will showcase far more skill and ability than they do right now.
